# TODO

The goal of this exercise is to test your Windows familiarity as well as your critical thinking and design skills. The task at hand is to build a lightweight **implementation of basic latency injection**. When you're done you should be able to add 100ms of latency to all outbound network requests, as well as revert the 100ms of latency in a *safe* way.

You should feel free to use any libraries or utilities you require to create the required impact, however keep in mind *simplicity* is one of our guiding product principles. Best of luck, and please feel free to send any questions to [recruiting@gremlin.com](recruiting@gremlin.com?subject=Windows%20%Chaos20Code%20Sample).
